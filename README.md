# Salary Survey Data Cleaning & Analysis

## Project Overview
This project takes a real-world, crowd-sourced salary survey dataset and transforms it from raw, messy data into a clean, structured format suitable for analysis.  
The goal is to demonstrate **data cleaning, transformation, and analysis skills** that are essential for data analytics roles.

The dataset contains:
- Inconsistent text formats
- Missing and null values
- Non-standard salary formats
- Varying date formats
- Free-text job titles and locations

By the end, you'll see a fully cleaned dataset and key insights about salary trends across roles, countries, and experience levels.
